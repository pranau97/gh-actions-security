**_Customizable Self-Hosted Runners for GitHub Actions_**

Sher is an open-source tool that lets you create and manage customizable ephemeral self-hosted runners for GitHub Actions. It is primarily designed to provide isolation for workflows that run on your infrastructure. Sher does this by creating a new runner on-demand on a discardable virtual machine, and then removing it after the workflow has completed.

Sher is available as a GitHub App - https://github.com/apps/sher-security-for-gh-actions
